## Project: Deep Learning Follow me

---


**Steps to complete the project:**  


1. Clone the [project repo](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-DeepLearning-Project.git).
2. Fill out the TODO's in the project code.
3. Optimize your network and hyper-parameters.
4. Train your network and achieve an accuracy of 40% (0.40) using the Intersection over Union IoU metric which is final_grade_score at the bottom of your notebook.
5. Make a brief writeup report summarizing why you made the choices you did in building the network.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1155/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it!

#### 2. The write-up conveys the an understanding of the network architecture.

#### 3. The write-up conveys the student's understanding of the parameters chosen for the the neural network.

#### 4. The student has a clear understanding and is able to identify the use of various techniques and concepts in network layers indicated by the write-up.

#### 5. The student has a clear understanding of image manipulation in the context of the project indicated by the write-up.

#### 6. The student displays a solid understanding of the limitations to the neural network with the given data chosen for various follow-me scenarios which are conveyed in the write-up.

### Model

#### 1. The model is submitted in the correct format. 

#### 2. The neural network must achieve a minimum level of accuracy for the network implemented.
